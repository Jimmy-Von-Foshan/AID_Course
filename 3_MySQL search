1.Search tools
	1.Order by 				#Show search results in certain order
		-> order by desc 	#descending order
		-> order by asc 	#ascending order

		#ie:
			-> select * from sanguo
			-> where country in ("shu") and name like "__"
			-> order by gongji desc;
	
	2.limit				#Limit the number of search result been popped
		-> limit 1,3 	#Show record 2,3,4
						#The first record in record "0"
		-> limit 3 		#Show first 3 records hence 1,2,3 

	3.Functions 
		1.Calculation		#Maximum,Minimun and Sumation, excel style
			-> max(field1)  
			-> min(field1) 
			-> sum(field1)
			#ie: 
				->select sum(gongji) from sanguo
				->where country = "Shu"
				#Returns sum of gongji matching "Shu"


		2.Count 						#Finger counting
			-> count(field1) as C_f1 	#Count field1,return Num_f1
										#"Null" excluded,"" included
			#ie:
				-> select count(name) as C_name
				-> from sanguo
				# Returns C_name, number of names exclude Null

	4.Group statement
		1.group by
			Group records specified by user input first
			and then find the desired result with functions

			ie:
				->select country,avg(gongji) from sanguo 	#Get data
				->group by country							#How to show results
				->order by avg(gongji) desc 				#Desired result
				->limit 2;									#Desired result

				#In this case records are grouped by "country" to find 
				the desired result "top 2 in avg(gongji)"

		2.having
			1.Used like "where" on created function by user
			2.Often used with group by function to filter the results returned from group by

			ie:
			-> select country,avg(gongji) from sanguo
			-> group by country
			-> having avg(gongji)>105 

				#"where" can't be used on created function like "avg(gongji)"
				It mush be used on existed parameter in the table
				In this case "having" is use instead.

	5.distnct
		1.Do not count the repeating contents
		2.Cant be used on user created function

		3.ie:
		->select distinct country from sanguo   #Returns "Wei","Shu","Wu"

		4.ie:
		->select count(distinct name) from sanguo 
		->where country = "Shu"					
		#Returns the number of distinct name in "Shu"

	6.Mathmatical operation in searching
		1.Signs: + - * / %

		2.ie:
		->select id,name,gongji*10 as NewGongji from sanguo
		#Show the gongji*10 of all heros
