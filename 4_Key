4_Key

1.Introduction
	1.Different ways to sort one or more columns of data
	2.Increase efficiency when searching for a data in a row

2.Index Key (MUL)
	1.Can be applied to more than 1 fieldname
	2.Field value can be repeated and works for NULL
	3.Usually appied on fields been frequently serached
	4.Index key is shown as "MUL"
	5.keytype for creation is "index"

3.Unique Key (UNI)
	1.Can be applied to more than 1 fieldname
	2.Field value can't be repeated but works for " "
	3.Unique key is show as "UNI"
	4.Keytype for creation is "unique" or "unique index"

4.Primary Key (PRI)
	1.Only 1 primary key in a table
	2.Cant be repeated and cant be NULL or " "
	3.Usually appied on field like "ID", which is unique 
	,recognizable and mandatory for each records.
	4.Keytype for creation is "primary" or "primary index"

5.Formate
	1.Add a keytype when creating table
		-> create table t2(
		-> id int,
		-> name char(20)
		-> keytype(id),
		-> keytype(name)
		->);
		
	2.Create/drop a keytype into existed table
		->alter table t1
		->add Keytype key(Name) 	#Create
		->drop Keytype key(Name)	#Delete

	3.Show all the key details in the table:
		-> desc t1;
		or >show index frome t1/G;

6.Auto increment
	1.Intro
		1.Use with primary key to increase field value 
		automaticly like "+="
		2.For "ID", simply insert "0" for each new records 
		and the id value will increments

	2.Create
		-> id int primary key auto_increment
		#When creating table
		-> alter table t1 modify name Datatype
		primary key auto_increment

	3.Delete
		-> alter table t1 modiify id int  
		#Drop the auto increment before dropping primary key


7.Foreign key
	1.Intro: 
		1.Select across muiltiple tables

		2.Cant add an record into subordinary table if it's 
		not in the primary table

		3.When record deleted in primary table it's also 
		deleted in secondary table

		4.If two keys are referenced, ie:Stu_id and id,
		the subordinary id will change automatically with 
		primary id.

		5.Subordinate record must be a kind of Key, usually "primary"

	2.Code:
		1.Subordinate t2 to t1
			->create table t2(...
			.....

			->foreign key(Stu_id) references t1(d) 
			#

			->on delete cascade 
			->on update cascade);

		2.Delete foriegn key(Cancle subordinate)
			-> show create table t1
			#Find the full name of foreign key and copy
			->alter table t1 drop foreign key paste;

		3.Add foreign key to existed table
			->alter table t2 add
			->foreign key (Stu_id) references (id)
			->on delete Cascade
			->on update Cascade

	3.Sync codes  			#delete and update commande
		1.-> cascade
			1.When records delete in prim table, it's deleted
			in subord table too.
			
			2.When referenced record is changed int prim table,
			the same changes is applied to record in subord table.

		2.-> restrict(default)
			1.Prohibit deleting record in prim table if it's also
			in the subord table 

			2.Update in the same way as cascade

		3.-> set null 
			1.When reocords delete in prim table, subord record is
			set to "NULL" in "id"

			2.Update in the same way as cascade
